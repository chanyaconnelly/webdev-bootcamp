            <p class="handscript">Hi Lovelies,</p>
    
            <p>The end of 2024 is approaching so I really want to up my game and make an impact on my career as a developer. I took a pretty long break on building my career as I, with limited experiences and advices, was struggling to figure out what my career path would be.
            I graduated a bachelor degree in business but I wasn't sure if the day-to-day job would fit me. I was stressed and confused about what I really want to do facing all kinds of pressures from society and everyone.</p>
    
            <p>With all that, now I'm committed to become a full-stack web developer and I bought this web development course quite a while back. I'm revamping up all my coding skills and ready to become a full time remote web developer by the end of this year.</p>
            
            <p>Within this course you will learn with me all the nitty-gritty on HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, PostgreSQL, Web3 and DApps.</p>
    
            <p>With no further a due, let's get started!</p>
